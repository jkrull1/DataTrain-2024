## Course Info

[Course Details: Git/GitHub Operator Track](https://www.bremen-research.de/data-train/courses/course-details?event_id=72)

### Course Background

Git is a powerful tool used for managing and tracking changes to code and documents. Paired with platforms like Github, it allows users to collaborate, automate tasks, and simplify their workflows. This course is designed to introduce Data Stewards to the basics of Git and Github, providing them with the skills and knowledge they need to use these tools effectively. Git's decentralized functionality also makes it ideal for use in environments with limited or no internet access.
It's worth noting that there are other tools similar to Github, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, and the principles learned in this course can be applied to these platforms as well.

### Learning contents
In this course, you will learn the basics of using Git and Github for managing and collaborating on projects. We will focus on using the command-line interface (CLI) tools of Git, as well as take a quick look at using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Through a series of lessons and hands-on exercises, you will learn how to create projects, track changes, collaborate with others, automate tasks, and more. By the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation in using Git and Github for your projects.

### Learning objectives

- Solid foundation in Git
- Ability to use Git to simplify the workflow and collaborate with others on complex projects

### Technical requirements
- Own laptop with Git installed
- Internet connection

## Preparation

This course is designed for beginners with no previous experience of Git or Github. If you're not familiar with the command line interface (CLI), don't worry. You will be given a step-by-step guide.
